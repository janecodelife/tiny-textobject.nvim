A lightweight, simple, and dependency-free Easily handle text objects (inner/around) without need for Tree-sitter.

---

## 🚀 Features
* **`if` (Inner Function):** Selects everything *inside* the function braces (`{ ... }`), automatically trimming the top and bottom whitespace lines.
* **`af` (Around Function):** Selects the entire function block, including the function signature (`public function name()`, `class`, etc.) and the braces.
* **Smart Lookahead:** If your cursor isn't directly on a function block when you press `af`, it automatically searches forward for the next one.
* **No Treesitter required:** Perfect for lightweight setups or languages where Treesitter isn't fully configured.
